This repository contains a set of R scripts developed to apply foundational programming skills to biologically relevant problems, with the aim of developing a clearer and more effective understanding of core bioinformatics and genomics concepts.
Project Descriptions:
The script GC Content.R demonstrates basic quality control by calculating GC content from a real human gene sequence. This project shows my ability to retrieve public genomic data, clean FASTA files, and perform simple quality checks that are relevant to assessing sequencing bias prior to analysis.
In Healthy Vs Treated.R, I explore differences in gene expression between healthy and treated samples. By calculating average expression levels and fold changes, this script reflects foundational principles of differential expression analysis and introduces the concept of identifying potential biomarkers based on changes in gene activity.
The script Marker Identification.R focuses on identifying marker genes that characterise different immune cell types based on expression patterns. This work demonstrates logical reasoning applied to biological data.
Through Translation.R, I implemented a simple DNA-to-protein translation tool using a custom codon dictionary. 
The script Variant Annotation.R simulates a clinical variant annotation workflow by matching a patient-specific genetic variant to a simplified database. 
In Comparision.R, I compare two viral genome sequences to identify the number of mutations between them.
Finally, Data Visualization.R demonstrates the use of data visualisation to communicate genomic information clearly. Using a simple bar chart to display gene activity levels across patients, this script highlights the importance of presenting data in an interpretable way for clinical audiences.
Learning Context and Future Development:
This portfolio represents an early stage in my learning. I am actively expanding these skills through coursework and online courses. In future, I plan to incorporate bioconductor workflows, statistical testing, more analysis, and complex genomic datasets.
